 Multiply your anger by about a hundred, Kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the Discovery Channel from time to time. But I guess you can't now, being dead and all. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd. I now issue a new commandment: Thou shalt do the dance. You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. Cities fall but they are rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered. Rehabilitated? Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means. Boxing is about respect. Getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot.

I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. I once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. Only perfect intentions. Bruce... I'm God. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world. That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. Cities fall but they are rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered.
